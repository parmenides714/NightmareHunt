# Nightmare Hunt

## Rules

Wounds: Cards that you gain either in hand or in your *Action Discard* as a result of being attacked.
Death: If you ever have *Wounds* in hand equal to your *Body* you die. Place the current *Encounter* into the *Encounter Discard*. Search the *Encounter Discard* for the *Boss*, and if found, place it on the bottom of the *Encounter Deck*. Place the *Encounter Discard* on top of the *Encounter Deck* without shuffling it. Then return to town.
Recovery: Whenever you have no cards left in your *Action Deck* add a *Wound* to your *Action Discard* then shuffle your *Action Discard* and place it face down as a new *Action Deck*.
Town: Whenever you return to *Town*, remove all *Wounds* from your *Action Deck*, *Action Discard*, and *Hand*. Shuffle them together, form a new *Action Deck* and draw a new *Hand*.
Reaction: You may take up to 1 *Reaction* to each enemy *Action*.
Cancel: If an action is cancelled it immediately ends without effect.
Time: Every *Action* has a *Time* cost. When playing an *Action* all enemies get *Energy* equal to the *Time* that *Action* took.
Energy: Enemies gain *Energy* as the player takes *Actions*. They spend that *Energy* to take their own *Actions*.
Power: How strong an attack is. Player attacks deal damage to the enemy equal to their *Power*. Prey attacks deal Wounds according to the Player's *Armor Track*.
Action Deck: Starts with 3 of each *Action*. May eventually contain *Wounds*.
Encounter Deck: Defines the list of encounters for a given level. Always ends with a *Boss*

As an additional cost to take a *Basic Action* discard a *non-Wound* card from your *Hand*.

Punch - Time 4 - Power 3

### Armor

Armor | Defense Track | Penalty
----- | ------------- | -------
Robes | 1+ 3+ 5+ Critical 7+ | None
Leather | 2+ 4+ 6+ Critical 8+ | Slow 2
Plate | 3+ 5+ 7+ Critical 9+ | Slow 4

You take wounds for each value on your *Defense Track* that an attack's *Power* is equal or greater to. Add these wounds to your *Action Discard*. When you suffer a *Critical* attack gain those wounds into your hand instead.

### Prey

If a *Prey* doesn't have a 0 Energy ability then it gains the following ability: 
Pass - 0 Energy - Do nothing.

Summon: Summoned enemies are *Trashed* at the end of the *Encounter*. They lose any "At the start of this *Encounter*" abilities.

Multiple Enemy Encounters: If an encounter contains more than one enemy they each gain energy when the player takes an action.

### Conditions
All *Conditions* can stack unless they say otherwise.

Burning - Whenever you take a non-Recovery Action, gain a Wound in your *Action Discard*. Lose this condition when you rest.
Vulnerability - Your *Armor Track* gains "3+". This stacks with any instances of 3+ already on your *Armor Track*. Lost this condition when you rest. 

### Game Play
You start in town and may choose to venture out. While in town you may change your equipped armor.
If you leave town, draw the top card from the encounter deck. If the encounter is a Prey you must fight it. Otherwise resolve the encounter and continue. You may return to town in between encounters if you choose, but this will reset the *Encounter Deck*.

#### Resolving Prey encounters
The Prey has the first turn. 

Prey Turn: The Prey uses the most expensive ability that they can afford.
Player's Turn: Choose and resolve an action. At the end of the turn draw cards from your *Action Deck* until you have cards in hand equal to your *Mind*.
